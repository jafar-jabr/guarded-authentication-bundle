Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing.

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before
maintainers accept and merge your work.

Coding standards
----------------

You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). If you don't know about any of them, you
should really read the recommendations.

__Note:__ Feel free to edit existing code if you think it can be better.

Documentation
-------------

You SHOULD write documentation.

Additional notes
----------------

Before submitting your Pull Request, please [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing).  
When submitting your Pull Request, please choose a title that makes sense, it will be used as message for the merge commit if your change is accepted.

Thank you!
